# Ms. Pacman AI for .NET

Overview
A rule-based heuristic-search controller for the original Ms. Pacman entering the
Ms. Pacman competition of WCCI 2008. The main purpose of all this code is of course to have an AI controller play Ms. Pacman with some measure of success. To do this there is basic framework for describing controllers and some different features they can use as well as complete freedom to implement your own features â€“ both in the controller or directly in the surrounding code.
